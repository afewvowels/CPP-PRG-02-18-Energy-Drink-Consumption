//  A soft drink company recently surveyed 16,500 of its customers and found that approximately
//  15 percent of those surveyed purchase one or more energy drinks per week. Of
//  those customers who purchase energy drinks, approximately 58 percent of them prefer
//  citrus-flavored energy drinks. Write a program that displays the following:
//  *The approximate number of customers in the survey who purchase one or more
//  energy drinks per week.
//  *The approximate number of customers in the survey who prefer citrus-flavored
//  energy drinks
